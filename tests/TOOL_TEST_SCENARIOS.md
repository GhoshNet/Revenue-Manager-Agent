# Published tool test scenarios (Phase 2)

Implement these as **property tests** in your `tests/test_tools.py`. You do not
need to match exact floating-point totals in unit tests if you document tolerance;
structural properties below are mandatory.

Assume a **correct ETL load** of the hackathon dataset into Postgres.

---

## Scenario 1 — Grain inequality (July OTB)

**Tool:** `get_otb_summary("2025-07", exclude_cancelled=True)`

**Properties:**

- `reservation_count < row_count` (unless you prove equality is impossible for this month)
- `room_nights >= reservation_count`
- `room_revenue <= total_revenue` for the same month (total includes non-room components)

---

## Scenario 2 — Cancellation filter changes counts

**Tool:** `get_otb_summary` for any month with known cancellations

**Properties:**

- `exclude_cancelled=True` → `row_count` strictly less than `exclude_cancelled=False`
  when the month contains cancelled stay rows
- `reservation_count` with exclusions ≤ `reservation_count` without exclusions

---

## Scenario 3 — Segment shares sum to one

**Tool:** `get_segment_mix("2025-07", macro_group=None)`

**Properties:**

- `sum(share_of_room_nights) == 1.0` ± 1e-6
- `sum(share_of_revenue) == 1.0` ± 1e-6
- Every share is between 0 and 1 inclusive

---

## Scenario 4 — Macro group filter narrows universe

**Tool:** `get_segment_mix("2025-07", macro_group="Retail")` vs `macro_group=None`

**Properties:**

- Filtered total `room_nights` ≤ unfiltered total `room_nights`
- Every returned segment has effective `macro_group == "Retail"`

---

## Scenario 5 — Pickup uses booking date, not stay date

**Tool:** `get_pickup_delta(booking_window_days=365, future_stay_from="2025-07-01")`

**Properties:**

- Result only includes stays with `stay_date >= future_stay_from`
- Changing `booking_window_days` to a very small value (e.g. 1) produces
  `new_reservations` ≤ the 365-day window result
- Document in test comments that `create_datetime` defines the booking window

---

## Scenario 6 — OTA concentration signal

**Tool:** `get_segment_mix("2025-08", macro_group=None)`

**Properties:**

- At least one segment with `market_code == "OTA"` exists in hackathon data
- `share_of_revenue` for OTA is strictly between 0 and 1
- Test fails loudly if OTA segment missing (signals broken ETL or wrong month)

---

## Scenario 7 — Detail-page completeness

**Tool:** ad hoc query or extended tool test

**Properties:**

- Every reservation on the data site list has been opened on its detail page during ETL
- `company_name`, `rate_plan_code`, `financial_status`, and `property_date` populated where the site shows them
- Row count matches the `/verify` page after a full pagination pass
- `load_manifest` has at least one row with `dataset_revision` matching `/verify`

---

## Scenario 8 — Provisional exclusion from default OTB

**Tool:** `get_otb_summary("2025-08")` vs raw count including `financial_status = 'Provisional'`

**Properties:**

- Default OTB `row_count` is strictly less than rows with only `Cancelled` excluded
  when provisional rows exist in that month
- `provisional_row_count` in `LOAD_PROOF.json` is > 0 after ETL

---

## Scenario 9 — As-of snapshot differs from current OTB

**Tool:** `get_as_of_otb("2025-08", as_of_utc="2025-05-01T12:00:00Z")`

**Properties:**

- Result may differ from `get_otb_summary("2025-08")` when cancellations or bookings
  occurred after `as_of_utc`
- Cancelled reservations with `cancellation_datetime <= as_of_utc` are excluded
- Bookings with `create_datetime > as_of_utc` are excluded

---

## Scenario 10 — Property date vs stay date

**Tool:** ad hoc SQL on loaded data

**Properties:**

- `property_date_mismatch_count` in `LOAD_PROOF.json` matches rows where
  `property_date <> stay_date`
- Tools that filter on `stay_month` use `stay_date`, not `property_date`, unless documented

---

## Scenario 11 — Block vs transient mix

**Tool:** `get_block_vs_transient_mix("2025-09")`

**Properties:**

- `block_share_of_room_nights + transient_share` implied totals reconcile:
  `block_room_nights + transient_room_nights` equals month OTB room nights from
  `get_otb_summary` ± rounding
- `block_share_of_room_nights` and `block_share_of_revenue` are each between 0 and 1
- `top3_company_revenue_share` ≤ 1.0
- `top_companies` has at most 3 entries, sorted by revenue descending

---

## Scenario 12 — Tool layer isolation

**Properties:**

- All five tools import and run without starting the agent HTTP server
- No agent-facing tool accepts a free-form SQL string parameter
- Each tool's docstring mentions **grain** (row vs reservation vs room night)
